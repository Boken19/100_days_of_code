    "**An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly  steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, U, or a downhill, D step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:**\n",
